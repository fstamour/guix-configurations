* How to fix the boot loader

2023-10-14 A few days ago, my system stopped booting apparently out of
nowhere.

1. I made a backup
2. I put Guix SD installer on a USB key
3. From the USB key, I was that I was able to mount all the
   file systems, but the root one was complaining that there was
   multiple file system signatures.
4. I used wipefs to fix some extraneous file system signatures
5. I used fsck to make sure everything else was fine
6. I followed [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Chrooting-into-an-existing-system.html][Chrooting into an existing system]] to try to re-install
   the boot loader (I thought it was corrupt or something).
7. In the end, I switched the boot loader from =grub-efi-bootloader= to
   =grub-efi-removable-bootloader=, on the hypothesis that the issue
   is either the motherboard's battery is dead and it keeps forgetting
   the efivars, or the efivars are "full. In any case, this fixed my
   issue. I hate UEFI.


Because I tried to chroot, try something, reboot many times, I ended
up writing some scripts. In the end, it looked like this:

1. Boot on the Guix SD installer
2. Mount the root partition ~mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt~
3. Mount the remaining partitions using a script ~/mnt/root/mount.sh~
4. chroot using a script ~/mnt/root/chroot.sh~
5. do some changes to the configurations
6. guix system reconfigure using a script ~./system reconfigure~

#+title: Git repositories

* Description

This directory contains script to easily clone git repositories and
create symlink to those repositories.

* Design

Summary:
- entry point =makefile=
- =makefile= includes =repos.mak=
- =makefile= has a rule to generate =repos.mak=
- =repos.mak= is generated from =repos.tsv= by =repos.awk=
- =repos.mak= is **not** version-controlled
- =.gitignore= excludes everything by default, then adds exceptions
- every repositories is cloned in this directory
- every repositories has a corresponding symlink in =~/dev/=

** Why clone everything here instead of into =~/dev/= directly?

Because I want to be able to easily make the distinction between the
repositories I cloned manually and those that were cloned (into
=~/dev/=) using these scripts.

** Why use a text file instead of just a script?

- To have only one source of truth (i.e. there is only one place where
  I write the name of a repository).
- To make changes easier.

For example, if I want to change what I do with each repo, I have less
places to changes: only =repos.awk=.

** Why a makefile?

- Because gnu make has the ability to regenerate itself or other
  makefiles without any fuss.
- Because it's easy to have a target to clone one specific repo, as
  opposed to having a shell script that would need quite a bit of
  argument parsing.
- Because it has good auto-completion (e.g. in fish, or even bash).
- It can easily run in parallel.

** Why awk?

- Awk excels at this kind of job (it was pretty much designed for
  these).
- It is very lightweight.
- It is is ubiquitous.

** Other

*** github.sh

Proof of concept scripts, to list all my repositories in GitHub. It's
able to generate another script =upstreams.sh= that goes through
every repositories I have cloned and add a new remote named
"upstream", when the repository is a fork.

It generated the temporary files:
- github.json
- upstreams.sh
- github.tsv

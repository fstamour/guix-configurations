* Tasks

** TODO Keyboard

*** DONE Add caps-lock as compose-key

*** DONE Swap () and {}

*** TODO xmodmap service doesn't work anymore

- I thinks it happens since I updated...
- OOOrrrr... since I'm using xsession...
- I only have the error =Service xmodmap could not be started.=

** DONE ssh-agent

** TODO Nvidia drivers

- To be able to change the brightness of the backlight
- I noticed that I can change the brightness of the screen in gdm
  (e.g. the keys work on the login screen).
- But xbacklight doesn't work...
- Maybe gdm uses wayland... and magically knows how to change the
  backlight's brightness...

** TODO Podman

For containers, obviously...

I might be able to get away with running =guix shell --container=

** DONE Put ~/.config/guix under git

*** DONE Move into ~/dev/

** TODO Stumpwm

git@github.com:fstamour/stumpwm-config.git

** TODO Emacs

*** TODO Use guix to install (most?) packages

*** TODO Clone my emacs configs

git@gitlab.com:fstamour/emacs-dot-files.git

**** TODO See if I can do that using guix-home.

From the manual:

> It is possible to manage stateful data with Guix Home, this includes
the ability to automatically clone Git repositories on the initial
setup of the machine, and periodically running commands like rsync to
sync data with another host. This functionality is still in an
experimental stage, though.

*** TODO Enable darkroom-mode and focus-mode with org-mode

maybe all text-modes?
maybe all programming modes???

** DONE EDITOR env variable

** TODO Clone repos

start with git@gitlab.com:fstamour/catchall.git

or Stumpwm's

** TODO fish is installed but is not in /etc/shells

So I can't chsh just yet...

** TODO Gforth 0.7.9 instead of 0.7.3

--with-source="mirror://gnu/gforth/gforth-0.7.9.tar.gz"
didn't work, the latest version in the mirrors were 0.7.3

--with-git-url=gforth="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/gforth/"

** Shepherd Services are not 100% declarative

If you remove a service (e.g. cuirass) from your configuration
- the service will still be running
- you won't be able to use =herd= to stop it
- the service's state (e.g. =/var/lib/.../= and databases) won't be
  cleaned-up.
- it's not easy to figure out _how_ to cleanup these things
- that's one of the reasons trying out stuff in a container is
  advantageous


** Cuirass

- I accidently disabled a specification, and I wasn't able to
  re-enable it...
- when an error occurs (e.g. bad specification), nothing is shown in
  the web UI, you have to "manually" look at the logs.
- it's hard to know what's going on (e.g. is it fetching the channel?
  evaluating it? is it building anything?)
- showing the logs would help a lot right out of the box

su -l cuirass -s /bin/sh
psql


sudo -u cuirass dropdb cuirass
sudo -u cuirass reatedb cuiras

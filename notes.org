* Tasks

** TODO Keyboard

*** TODO xmodmap service doesn't work anymore

- I thinks it happens since I updated...
- OOOrrrr... since I'm using xsession...
- I only have the error =Service xmodmap could not be started.=

** DONE ssh-agent

** TODO Nvidia drivers

- To be able to change the brightness of the backlight
- I noticed that I can change the brightness of the screen in gdm
  (e.g. the keys work on the login screen).
- But xbacklight doesn't work...
- Maybe gdm uses wayland... and magically knows how to change the
  backlight's brightness...

** TODO Podman

For containers, obviously...

I might be able to get away with running =guix shell --container=

**** TODO See if I can do that using guix-home.

From the manual:

> It is possible to manage stateful data with Guix Home, this includes
the ability to automatically clone Git repositories on the initial
setup of the machine, and periodically running commands like rsync to
sync data with another host. This functionality is still in an
experimental stage, though.

*** TODO Enable darkroom-mode and focus-mode with org-mode

maybe all text-modes?
maybe all programming modes???

** DONE EDITOR env variable

** TODO Clone repos

start with git@gitlab.com:fstamour/catchall.git

So I can't chsh just yet...
